# 🎯 Godot Tekko Ecosystem Integration Strategy

## 🎪 **UNIFIED PLATFORM VISION**

## 🗺️ **INTEGRATION APPROACH: "CREATIVE JOURNEY PATHS"**

### **Current User Types → Enhanced Roles**

```
EXISTING ECOSYSTEM:
👤 User (buys assets) → 🎓 Student (learns + buys)
🎨 Partner (sells assets) → 👨‍🏫 Creator-Teacher (sells + teaches)
👑 Admin (manages platform) → 🏛️ Super Admin (oversees all)

NEW ECOSYSTEM ADDITIONS:
🏫 Teacher (pure educator)
🎮 Studio Partner (premium creator)
```

```

#### **Partner Journey Enhancement**
```
Asset Creator → Asset + Course Creator → Studio Teacher → Premium Studio
      ↓                ↓                     ↓               ↓
